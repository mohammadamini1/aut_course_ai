Project 1:
Project describes a game that involves arranging cards with different colors and numbers in a specific order. The goal of the game is to have all cards in each section of the game with the same color and in descending order from left to right. The problem can be solved using different AI algorithms such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), Iterative Deepening Search (IDS), and A* Search with an admissible heuristic.

Project 2:
Project describes an advanced version of the Sudoku game, incorporating color assignments to the cells along with numbers. The implementation of this advanced Sudoku game involves utilizing the Backtracking algorithm, along with the MRV (Minimum Remaining Values) and Degree heuristics. Furthermore, while assigning values, Forward Checking is applied to appropriately adjust the domain of other variables.

Project 3:
This AI course project involves designing a program that can guess the name of the poet who composed a given line of poetry. The dataset consists of poems from three famous Iranian poets: Ferdowsi, Hafez, and Molana. The implementation involves natural language processing techniques for text preprocessing and vocabulary construction. Language models (bigram and unigram) are created for each poet to capture word probabilities and relationships within the poems. The model's performance is evaluated using different hyperparameter values, and the best configuration is determined based on accuracy. Overall, the project leverages AI techniques in natural language processing and language modeling to achieve accurate poet predictions for the provided poetry lines.
